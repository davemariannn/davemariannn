# Dave Marian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a indie developer, educator and creator, focussing mostly on games and media automation. I aim to build my projects mostly myself, since I like to understand what is going on under the hood. However, I don't shy away from using other people's solutions if the need arises. I publish videos and occasionally stream on my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dave_marian">Dave Marian</a>, talking about games, media as well as the industry and culture around them.

  ### Dave's coding journey.

  I first dipped my toes into programming when I looked up how to use HTML to spice up my high school punk band's myspace page. I think I successfully blinded many people with my results - not because of the quality of the code but from the epileptic effects I more or less intentionally created. I kept that up as a hobby for a while, making small websites - often just for myself, using primarily HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript. As I went to University I got more interested in programming as I thought it can help me make some tasks in other software packages easier. I tried MAX for live to make my own audio plugins, but what really sealed the deal was when I discovered Unity. I started to learn C# and wrote some smaller games and even made my Master's project in form of a Unity game. The most challenging part of it was to write a piece of software that let me play animations for my character controler and have them blend into each other to make look more natural in game. As soon as I was finished Unity added Mechanim to their engine, which did the same thing only better. After my MA I worked as a filmmaker for a while, travelling, before I settled down and got a job in a film archive. I mainly scanned, restaurated and color graded old analouge film footage, but I was also responsible to setup and maintain our internal server structure, since I was the only one at that place who used Linux (we had an external server guy, but management wanted someone internal as well). I learned Python during that time to automate a variety of tasks, and also worked a lot with Raspberry Pies, as we used them extensively in our events (museum-like screening instalations). At some point I got hired by a media school and ended up heading the whole academic section for 5 years teaching and developing courses on media, film making, game development and stuff like that. During that time I primarily used Python for data-related work with numpy, Pandas, and matplotlib. I quit the job after Covid and the birth of my son, and got back into gamedev projects on Unity and Godot.
